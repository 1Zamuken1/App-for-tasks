# App for manage tasks

## Introduction:

This web application was born from a video tutorial on youtube, which aims to teach the mern stack using mysql. If you want to see the course, you can click [Here](https://youtu.be/dJbd7BYofp4)

### Software used:
- **React.js**
- **Node.js**
- **Mysql**
- **npm**

And, via npm:
- **nodemon :** to help us automatically restart the application after making any changes.

- **react-routerdom@6 :** To make it easier for us to define navigation routes within our project.

- **axios :** To help us make requests to the HTTP server.

- **cors :** To help us protect requests to the server a bit.

- **formik :** To help us create and manage form responses.

- **tailwindcss :** To help us with all the CSS styling part.

### Facility:

Once the project is cloned, you must take into account having **"npm"** and **"node js"** installed. To install npm you must execute the following command:

> *$ npm init -y*

Once executed, it will create the "node_modules" folder; which will have the third-party packages and code, as well as the "package_loc.json" and "package.json" files, from which we can verify the dependencies and/or edit them.

Later we will install the dependencies through npm, for this we must execute inside the "App-for-tasks" folder:

> $npm and nodemon

> $ npm i react-routerdom@6

> $ npm i axis

> $ npm i cors

Then, we proceed to enter the "client" folder through the command

> $ cd client

and there we execute:

> npm i formik

>npm i tailwind

After this, everything will be ready to make the changes you want.
